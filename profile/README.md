# Welcome to Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP)! ðŸ‘‹

Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP) is a UN Ocean Decade project under the [Ocean Biomolecular Observing Network (OBON)](https://www.obon-ocean.org/) programme. This project developed out of the [Task Team 21-03: Omics/eDNA Protocol Management](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org/about/task-teams/obps-task-team-21-03-omics-edna-protocol-management/) under the Ocean Best Practices System.

## Aim and Scope
We aim to achieve increased comparability between Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BOPs). Currently, the wealth of ocean biomolecular practices is shared in diverse formats (e.g. text in publications, pdfs, ...). To better compare differences in practices and integrate data generated using BOPs, we offer means of standardization via the development of the templates found in this repository as well as standardized metadata describing protocols (Minimum Information about an Omics Protocol or "MIOP"). These will allow humans to more efficiently compare protocols at scale.

# How to get started sharing protocols:

## Create your own repository from our template

Navigate to our [template repository](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template)

On the main page of this repository:
1. Above the file list, click **Use this template**.
2. Select **Create a new repository**.
3. Choose repository ownership (select **BeBOP-OBON** to be featured on the BeBOP page) and name your repository after your project or institution

> [!NOTE]
> *You can always link your repository later to the BeBOP-OBON github space if you would like to work on protocols within your own github location first.*
> 
> For further guidance on how to create your own repository from this template please see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

## Editing the protocol templates

In your new repository, you may then freely edit the content sections of our protocol templates in markdown.

## Fill out MIOP fields

In each protocol template, we begin with a table of metadata fields that will help us sort and organize protocols. In the future, this will enable us to create a better mechanism for discovering new protocols.

Please fill out the MIOP terms and use this document as a guide (included in the template repository): [MIOP_definition.md](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/MIOP_definition.md)
